1
00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:05.835
I don't know who you are

2
00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:09.547
I don't know what you are

3
00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:12.296
if you are looking for ransom

4
00:00:13.156 --> 00:00:14.248
Kentucky why don't have money

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.806
I do have

6
00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:18.736
very particular set of skills

7
00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:21.826
skills I have acquired over a very long career

8
00:00:22.692 --> 00:00:24.941
skills that make me a nightmare for people like you

9
00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:29.391
if you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it

10
00:00:29.914 --> 00:00:33.635
I will not look for you I will not pursue you

11
00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:35.290
but if you don't

12
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.867
I will look for you I will find you

13
00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:42.234


14
00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:48.132
good luck

15
00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:51.599


16
00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:59.466
