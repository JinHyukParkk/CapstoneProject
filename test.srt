Adam Stewart

2
00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:10.090
I think that's already but I didn't think

3
00:00:11.005 --> 00:00:12.561
beside a man everyday

4
00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:20.360
and I can't help to feel better

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.817


6
00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:23.881
now I really want to

7
00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:32.415
how you mean you work alongside in a gem

8
00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:39.499


9
00:00:40.222 --> 00:00:41.312


10
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:47.246
how to define an answer well that's why I disagree with you

11
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:50.749
because I'm never the co-worker salts is never even met

12
00:00:51.768 --> 00:01:04.188
but allow me to buy you another time and I'll tell you why you're wrong accident

13
00:01:04.843 --> 00:02:19.599
open settings looks like a $600 for the day of clear rain in the evening

14
00:02:20.155 --> 00:02:39.191


15
00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:43.704
send a message every day at 6 a.m. so we we know will be in every 6 a.m.

16
00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:59.567
oh my God

17
00:03:00.291 --> 00:04:05.269
what happened

18
00:04:10.313 --> 00:04:10.329


19
00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:19.139


20
00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:22.234
I need a new message today systems have m y s s a y a famous Jack voice of Princess direct to 53 degrees 24 minutes north

21
00:04:23.016 --> 00:04:23.810
degrees west

22
00:04:25.289 --> 00:05:13.541
that. That's the only Gem and you need to know.

23
00:05:15.518 --> 00:05:15.813


24
00:05:24.828 --> 00:05:26.301
