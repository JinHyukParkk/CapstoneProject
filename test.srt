1
00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:05.775
I don't know who you are

2
00:00:08.826 --> 00:00:09.496
I don't know what you want

3
00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:12.213
if you are looking for ransom

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.203
I can tell you I don't have money

5
00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:15.762
but what I do have

6
00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:18.593
particular set of skills

7
00:00:19.994 --> 00:00:21.536
skills I have acquired over a very long career

8
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:24.748
skills that make me a nightmare for people like you

9
00:00:27.288 --> 00:00:29.177
if you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it

10
00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:33.566
I will not look for you I will not pursue you

11
00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:35.257
but if you don't

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.802
I will look for you I will find you

13
00:00:41.764 --> 00:00:42.088
and I will kill you

14
00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:48.008
good luck

15
00:00:50.573 --> 00:00:51.135


16
00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:59.466
