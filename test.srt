1
00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:05.759
I don't know who you are

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.473
I don't know what you want

3
00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:12.156
if you are looking for ransom

4
00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:14.180
I can tell you I don't have money

5
00:00:15.487 --> 00:00:15.736
I do have

6
00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:18.561
particular set of skills

7
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.496
skills I have acquired over a very long career

8
00:00:22.816 --> 00:00:22.948
Skittles

9
00:00:23.454 --> 00:00:24.729
that make me a nightmare for people like you

10
00:00:27.302 --> 00:00:28.406
if you let my daughter go now.

11
00:00:28.948 --> 00:00:29.145
that'll be the end of it

12
00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:33.551
I will not look for you I will not pursue you

13
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:35.239
but if you don't

14
00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:40.785
I will look for you I will find you

15
00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:42.038
and I will kill you

16
00:00:50.578 --> 00:00:51.086


17
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.466
